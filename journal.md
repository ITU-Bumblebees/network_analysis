# What did we do, where are we rn

### 10-11-2022
Today we posed a research question "What genes should be targeted by CRISPR to avoid the most harm?"
We are currently working on: figuring out how to define "harm".

Current ideas of harm measurement:
Cool things that could be used to decide node importance:
- Node degree
	- A highly connected node is based, and should be removed
- Weighted degree
	- What if a disease is highly connected, should that make the gene degree less important?
- Hereditary nodes
	- What if a disease/gene is hereditary?
- Chronic illness
	- Are chronic illnesses worse than not chronic?
- Mortal illness
	- If you die from the disease, does that make it worse?

Currently:
Germán: Working on calculating weighted degree of nodes (genes). Issues: Accessing different genes based on ID.
Hubert: Updating Graph.py, issues with pulling since project has been updated.
Chris: Doing the same thing as Germán
Paula: Helping Chris, researching genes.
Laurids: Writing this doc, messing around with org.
